# Prompt-X — AI Interrogation Game

**Prompt-X** is an immersive browser-based AI interrogation game where you play as a detective interrogating the prime suspect in a murder case, powered by Google Gemini AI.

## 🎮 Overview

You interrogate **Adrian Vale**, Lead Data Analyst at Aegis Forensic Analytics, suspected of killing his colleague **Daniel Mercer** on 14 September 2026. Your goal: ask the right questions, expose contradictions, and push Adrian's stress to breaking point to extract a full confession.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + TanStack Router
- **3D Scene**: React Three Fiber (Three.js)
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) serving the interrogation AI engine
- **AI**: Google Gemini API (`gemini-3.5-flash-lite`) for dynamic suspect responses
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + custom retro terminal aesthetic

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.10+
- Google Gemini API Key

   cd Promptx
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies**
   ```bash

   ```

3. **Install Python backend dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn google-genai python-dotenv
   ```

4. **Set up your Gemini API key**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
